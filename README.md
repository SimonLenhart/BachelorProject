# Prototype for Gesture-Based Ticket Vending Machine

This folder contains my bachelorproject, which was developed at the Human Computer Interaction department of the University of Konstanz. 

## Development
The project topic was "Touch-less interaction with a ticket vending machine". 
In order to examine possible interaction types and corresponding technologies, a literature analysis was done in the preceding bachelor seminar. If you are interested in this seminar report, please contact me. <br />
Finally, I decided to control the system only via hand/finger movements. <br />
Those movements were captured by the Leap Motion controller. 

## Used Technology
Programming Languages: HTML5/CSS3/JS  <br />
Library: jQuery <br />
Hardware: Leap Motion controller

## Setup 
To execute the web application, please clone/download the whole project and open the [HTML index file](index.html). <br />
Since the focus of the project was touch-less interaction, the interface is developed specifically for gesture-based interaction. However, it is still possible to interact with the system via mouse/keyboard.
