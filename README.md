This folder contains the Bachelorproject of Simon Lenhart from the Human Computer Interaction department of the University of Konstanz. 

The project was to develop a prototype of a touch-less ticket vending machine.  

This task was solved by catching the users motions with the Leap Motion controller and then using these motions to control the system. 
The whole project is coded in HTML/CSS/JS.
