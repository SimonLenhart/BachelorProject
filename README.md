This folder contains the my bachelorproject, which was developed at the Human Computer Interaction department of the University of Konstanz. 

The project topic was "Touch-less interaction with a ticket vending machine". 
Therefore, the prototype of a fully gesture-based ticket vending machine was created. 
The capturing of the users motions was done with the Leap Motion controller and these captured motions were then used to control the system. 
The whole project is created as a web application and coded in HTML/CSS/JS.
